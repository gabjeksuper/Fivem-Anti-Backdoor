# 🛡️ Advanced FiveM Anti-Backdoor & Infrastructure Defense

> **The definitive solution against Blum Panel, Cipher, and modern obfuscated backdoors.**

**Current Version:** v4.7 (Updated 19/01/2026)  
**Status:** 🟢 Active & Detecting

---

## 🚨 The Threat is Real
FiveM servers are currently under attack by sophisticated malware families like **Blum Panel**, **Cipher**, and more. These aren't just simple "force op" scripts anymore. They utilize:
* **XOR Encryption & Hex Obfuscation** to hide deep inside legitimate resources.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** to hijack your VPS.
* **Supply Chain Attacks** (viruses hidden in leaked scripts).

### ⚠️ A Critical Warning: DO NOT PAY THE EXTORTION
Many server owners realize they are infected and try to pay the backdoor creators for a "whitelist" or to be "removed" from the panel. **This is a trap.**

1.  **They still have access:** You are giving money to the people who hacked you. They keep the backdoor in your files.
2.  **You are being farmed:** They can revoke your "whitelist" anytime and ask for more money.
3.  **Security Risk:** Giving them money doesn't patch the vulnerability. Your server remains wide open.

**Don't negotiate with threat actors. Neutralize them.**

## ⚔️ Our Solution: iDevScanner & "Black Hole" Protection

We provide an advanced cleanup service and proprietary tools that go far beyond what standard paid or free scanners can do.

### 1. iDevScanner v4.7 (Premium Tool)
A dedicated, regularly updated heuristic scanner designed to unpack and detect:
* **Comprehensive Database:** Detects Blum, Cipher, and previously unknown private backdoors.
* **Anti-Obfuscation Engine:** Automatically unpacks and analyzes heavily encrypted code layers to find malicious logic hidden underneath.
* **High-Risk Behavior Analysis:** Identifies scripts attempting to execute system commands (RCE), reverse shells, or unauthorized network connections.
* **Zero-Day Readiness:** Already updated to detect the newest self replicating variants that attempt to regenerate themselves within your system.
  
### 2. The "Black Hole" Protection (Infrastructure Level)
Cleaning the files is step one. Ensuring they can **never** connect back to the hacker is step two.
We implement a massive, proprietary **1.64GB Network Blocklist**:
* **500 Million+ Domains:** Blocks every known C2 (Command & Control) server used by FiveM malware.
* **Zero Lag:** Works at the network/hosts level. **0% MS impact** on your server performance.
* **Instant Neutralization:** Even if a player injects a script, it cannot "call home". The backdoor becomes useless.

## 🔍 Technical Capabilities (Sneak Peek)

The **iDevScanner** engine is built to recognize specific signatures that others miss:

- **Advanced Logic Analysis:** Identifies complex XOR structures and variable manipulation used by the Blum family, even when heavily obfuscated.
- **Deep Decryption Search:** Detects and decodes custom encryption keys specifically associated with private and undocumented backdoors.
- **Heuristic NodeJS Scans:** Detects dynamic payload injection and potential RCE (Remote Code Execution) vectors disguised as standard library calls.
- **Web Asset Integrity:** Scans UI files (`.html`, `.js`) for hidden "call-home" triggers, client-side data exfiltration, and malicious external connections.
